# Mental Health Fitness Tracker
The Mental Health Fitness Tracker project focuses on analyzing and predicting mental fitness levels of individuals from various countries with different mental disorders. It utilizes regression techniques to provide insights into mental health and make predictions based on the available data.


## INSTALLATION

To use the code and run the examples, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```
    
3. Download the project files and navigate to the project directory.
   

## SUMMARY
- Developed a fully functional Mental Health Fitness Tracker ML model using Python and scikit-learn.
- Utilized 12 types of regression algorithms to achieve precise results in analyzing and predicting mental fitness levels from over 150 countries.
- Cleaned, preprocessed, and engineered features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
- Optimized the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and implementing ensemble methods, resulting in an impressive accuracy percentage of 98.50%.
